        <h2><i>Why I like Science</i></h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy learning about science because I have always been 
            curious about the nature of this world and the laws that
            govern it. Human beings are not the fastest, not the strongest,
            nor can we fly, but we are able to discover how to use nature to 
            our advantage. Many theories discovered in physics seem counter intuitive,
            such as quantum mechanics and general relativity, but have nonetheless
            have captured the imagination of physicists around the world.
